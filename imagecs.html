    Across cultures and over time, people tend to possess the universal motivation to respect "self". Self- esteem is arguably the most studied subject in the behavioral sciences. Self-esteem describes a person’s overall subjective sense of personal worth and value. Invariably self-esteem defines how much you appreciate and like yourself regardless of the circumstances.  Self-esteem is defined by a couple of factors, they include; self of belonging, identity, feeling of security, self- confidence, feeling of competence. Many theorists have posited that people crave self- esteem because it is associated with positive well-being. Leary and Baumister (2000) identified at least four functions of self-esteem over the years, for Leary nature would really not have associated affect so strongly with self-esteem by chance. The fact that "affect" and self-esteem are do connected begs the question of why they are so connected.
    Humanistic theorists propose that self-esteem is a viable indicator for how congruent we are, with our true selves. From this perspective, contingent self-esteem is generally seen as unhealthy or maladaptive and it leads to lower self-esteem because it does not reflect one’s true/independent desires and potentials.
